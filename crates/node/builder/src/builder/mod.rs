/// Declaratively construct a node.
///
/// [`NodeBuilder`] provides a [builder-like interface][builder] for composing
/// components of a node.
///
/// ## Order
///
/// Configuring a node starts out with a [`NodeConfig`] (this can be obtained from cli arguments for
/// example) and then proceeds to configure the core static types of the node:
/// [`NodeTypesWithEngine`], these include the node's primitive types and the node's engine types.
///
/// Next all stateful components of the node are configured, these include all the
/// components of the node that are downstream of those types, these include:
///
///  - The EVM and Executor configuration: [`ExecutorBuilder`](crate::components::ExecutorBuilder)
///  - The transaction pool: [`PoolBuilder`](crate::components::PoolBuilder)
///  - The network: [`NetworkBuilder`](crate::components::NetworkBuilder)
///  - The payload builder: [`PayloadBuilder`](crate::components::PayloadServiceBuilder)
///
/// Once all the components are configured, the node is ready to be launched.
///
/// On launch the builder returns a fully type aware [`NodeHandle`] that has access to all the
/// configured components and can interact with the node.
///
/// There are convenience functions for networks that come with a preset of types and components via
/// the [`Node`] trait, see `reth_node_ethereum::EthereumNode` or `reth_optimism_node::OpNode`.
///
/// The [`NodeBuilder::node`] function configures the node's types and components in one step.
///
/// ## Components
///
/// All components are configured with a [`NodeComponentsBuilder`] that is responsible for actually
/// creating the node components during the launch process. The
/// [`ComponentsBuilder`](crate::components::ComponentsBuilder) is a general purpose implementation
/// of the [`NodeComponentsBuilder`] trait that can be used to configure the executor, network,
/// transaction pool and payload builder of the node. It enforces the correct order of
/// configuration, for example the network and the payload builder depend on the transaction pool
/// type that is configured first.
///
/// All builder traits are generic over the node types and are invoked with the [`BuilderContext`]
/// that gives access to internals of the that are needed to configure the components. This include
/// the original config, chain spec, the database provider and the task executor,
///
/// ## Hooks
///
/// Once all the components are configured, the builder can be used to set hooks that are run at
/// specific points in the node's lifecycle. This way custom services can be spawned before the node
/// is launched [`NodeBuilderWithComponents::on_component_initialized`], or once the rpc server(s)
/// are launched [`NodeBuilderWithComponents::on_rpc_started`]. The
/// [`NodeBuilderWithComponents::extend_rpc_modules`] can be used to inject custom rpc modules into
/// the rpc server before it is launched. See also [`RpcContext`] All hooks accept a closure that is
/// then invoked at the appropriate time in the node's launch process.
///
/// ## Flow
///
/// The [`NodeBuilder`] is intended to sit behind a CLI that provides the necessary [`NodeConfig`]
/// input: [`NodeBuilder::new`]
///
/// From there the builder is configured with the node's types, components, and hooks, then launched
/// with the [`WithLaunchContext::launch`] method. On launch all the builtin internals, such as the
/// `Database` and its providers [`BlockchainProvider`] are initialized before the configured
/// [`NodeComponentsBuilder`] is invoked with the [`BuilderContext`] to create the transaction pool,
/// network, and payload builder components. When the RPC is configured, the corresponding hooks are
/// invoked to allow for custom rpc modules to be injected into the rpc server:
/// [`NodeBuilderWithComponents::extend_rpc_modules`]
///
/// Finally all components are created and all services are launched and a [`NodeHandle`] is
/// returned that can be used to interact with the node: [`FullNode`]
///
/// The following diagram shows the flow of the node builder from CLI to a launched node.
///
/// include_mmd!("docs/mermaid/builder.mmd")
///
/// ## Internals
///
/// The node builder is fully type safe, it uses the [`NodeTypesWithEngine`] trait to enforce that
/// all components are configured with the correct types. However the database types and with that
/// the provider trait implementations are currently created by the builder itself during the launch
/// process, hence the database type is not part of the [`NodeTypesWithEngine`] trait and the node's
/// components, that depend on the database, are configured separately. In order to have a nice
/// trait that encapsulates the entire node the
/// [`FullNodeComponents`](reth_node_api::FullNodeComponents) trait was introduced. This
/// trait has convenient associated types for all the components of the node. After
/// [`WithLaunchContext::launch`] the [`NodeHandle`] contains an instance of [`FullNode`] that
/// implements the [`FullNodeComponents`](reth_node_api::FullNodeComponents) trait and has access to
/// all the components of the node. Internally the node builder uses several generic adapter types
/// that are then map to traits with associated types for ease of use.
///
/// ### Limitations
///
/// Currently the launch process is limited to ethereum nodes and requires all the components
/// specified above. It also expects beacon consensus with the ethereum engine API that is
/// configured by the builder itself during launch. This might change in the future.
///
